# User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

This section contains user stories and acceptance criteria derived from
approved Use Cases and Functional Requirements.

Each Use Case has its own folder containing atomic user stories.
Acceptance criteria are written in Given/When/Then format and are intended
to be directly reusable for development and testing.
