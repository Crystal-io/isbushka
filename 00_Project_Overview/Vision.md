# Project Vision

## Background

ISBUSHKA is a small service business (beauty salon) that requires a simple,
transparent, and reliable system for managing daily operations.

The initial solution is implemented using a no-code platform, but the focus
of this project is not tooling — it is system design and documentation.

## Business Problem

Manual tracking of appointments and finances leads to:
- errors in scheduling
- lack of financial transparency
- limited reporting
- poor scalability

---

## Proposed Solution

A lightweight salon management system that:
- centralizes client and appointment data
- tracks financial operations
- provides basic reporting
- can be extended in the future

---

## Success Criteria

- Reduced operational errors
- Clear financial visibility
- Easy onboarding for non-technical users
- Structured documentation enabling further scaling
