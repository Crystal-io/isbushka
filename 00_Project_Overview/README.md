# Discovery Phase — ISBUSHKA Project

## Purpose of Discovery

The Discovery phase aims to build a **shared understanding of the business problem, domain, scope, and constraints** before moving into solution design and implementation.

For the ISBUSHKA project, Discovery focuses on:
- understanding salon operations and pain points,
- defining business goals and success criteria,
- aligning stakeholders and user roles,
- establishing domain language and boundaries,
- fixing scope, assumptions, and risks early,
- preparing a solid foundation for further design and delivery activities.

This phase deliberately avoids technical implementation details and UI design.

## Discovery Outcomes

As a result of the Discovery phase, the following outcomes were achieved:

- Clear business vision and objectives
- Documented current-state problems (As-Is)
- Identified stakeholders, actors, and user goals
- Defined system scope and explicit exclusions
- Established domain model and terminology
- Captured high-level functional expectations and business rules
- Identified key risks, assumptions, constraints, and dependencies
- Clarified data sources and ownership

Discovery is considered **completed and approved** once these artifacts are in place.

## Discovery Artifacts Overview

The Discovery phase for ISBUSHKA is documented through the following artifacts.

### 1. Vision & Business Objectives
**Purpose:** Define why the system exists and what business value it delivers.

- `01_Vision.md`
- `02_Business_Objectives.md`

---

### 2. Problem Statement / As-Is Analysis
**Purpose:** Describe the current situation, existing pain points, and reasons for change.

- `03_Problem_Statement_AsIs.md`

---

### 3. Stakeholders & Actors
**Purpose:** Identify all parties involved in or affected by the system.

- `04_Stakeholders_and_Actors.md`

---

### 4. Personas & User Goals
**Purpose:** Describe primary users and their goals within the system.

- `09_Personas_and_User_Goals.md`

---

### 5. Scope Definition
**Purpose:** Clearly define what is included and excluded from the current solution.

- `07_Scope.md`
- `13_Out_of_Scope_and_Future_Considerations.md`

---

### 6. Assumptions, Constraints & Dependencies
**Purpose:** Capture known assumptions, external limitations, and dependencies that influence the solution.

- `05_Assumptions_Constraints_Dependencies.md`

---

### 7. Domain Understanding & Terminology
**Purpose:** Establish a shared domain language and conceptual boundaries.

- `06_Domain_Decomposition.md`
- `08_Glossary_and_Terminology.md`

---

### 8. High-Level Requirements & Business Rules
**Purpose:** Capture functional expectations and core business rules at a high level, without implementation details.

- `10_Requirements_Backlog_HL.md`
- `12_Process_and_Rules_Overview.md`

---

### 9. Risks, Data Sources & Ownership
**Purpose:** Identify project risks and define responsibility for key data entities.

- `14_Risks_and_Mitigations.md`
- `15_Data_Sources_and_Ownership.md`

---

## Transition to Next Phase

With Discovery completed, the project transitions into the **Design phase**, starting with:

- Functional Requirements detailing
- Functional Specifications
- Business process modeling (BPMN To-Be)
- Architecture and system design artifacts

Discovery artifacts serve as the **baseline and source of truth** for all subsequent phases.

**Status:** Completed  
**Owner:** Business/System Analyst  
**Approval:** Implicit (case-study project)
