# 11. Process and Business Rules Overview

## Purpose
This document provides a high-level overview of key business processes
and cross-cutting business rules before detailed BPMN modeling.

## Key Process Areas 
- Client lifecycle
- Appointment lifecycle
- Financial operations lifecycle
- Calendar synchronization

## Cross-Cutting Business Rules
- Appointment is always created from a client context
- Service classification does not define price or duration
- Appointment completion is triggered by linked income payment
- Financial operations are the single source of truth for pricing

## Notes
Detailed process flows are defined later in BPMN diagrams.
